Using the National Park Service's API and accompanying documentation, the end user will be able to input a location, and the program
will return the closest national parks relative to them. We'll begin with the 10 closest parks, as there are a whopping number of national
parks (upwards of 500).


The National Park Service's API and documentation page can be found here:
https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm


To begin, the user will input a location value. Using geopy, a Python module, the value will be converted first to the location, and then
the location will be converted to a latitude-longitude tuple. 

Documentation for the geopy module can be found here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy


All national parks will be taken from the NPS API and converted to key: value pairs of {Park: LatLong Value}. Using geopy, the LatLong
value from the user will be used to find all distances from every national park in the NPS database. This program will then list the 10
national parks the shortest distance from the user, in ascending order.
